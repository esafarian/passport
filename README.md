Passport agency appointment checker

Bot that fills in appointment information on passportappointment.travel.state.gov/ and checks for available appointments in selected passport agencies. Once an appointment is found, an email alert is sent to notify the user that a matching appointment is available.

Doesn't work, could not figure out how to bypass CAPTCHA on the website.
